# TECHIN510_TattooGenerator

## Project objectives
- To design and develop a web application that generates custom tattoo designs based on user preferences, keywords, and style choices.
- To provide a visually rich and interactive interface for users to preview, download, or save tattoo designs.
- To enable inspiration through browsing, personalization, and optional sharing.
- To explore generative AI or design algorithms for dynamic tattoo creation.

## Target users and their needs
Users: 
- Individuals exploring tattoo ideas (first-timers or repeat clients).
- Tattoo enthusiasts seeking inspiration.
- Tattoo artists looking for design prompts or to share flash sheets.

Need:
- An easy-to-use tool to generate tattoo designs based on personal keywords, themes, or styles (e.g., traditional, minimalist, abstract).
- A preview system to visualize tattoos in different placements (e.g., forearm, ankle).
- Ability to save, download, or share designs for future reference or to take to a tattoo artist.
- Optional inspiration browsing from a community gallery or trending ideas.

## Key deliverables
- A responsive web application with:
    - A form or input interface to gather design preferences.
    - A design generation engine (using either prebuilt assets, generative AI, or parametric design).
    - A design preview page with download or save options.
    - An optional gallery or community inspiration board.
- Backend database (if needed) to store saved or shared designs.
- Clean and modern UI/UX focusing on artistic aesthetics and simplicity.
- Documentation and user guide.
- Deployed live version and source code repository.


## Special constraints (e.g., regulatory compliance)
- Copyright & Licensing: Ensure generated images are original, open-license, or user-owned to avoid copyright infringement.
- AI Integration (If Used): Adhere to platform policies for AI-generated content (e.g., OpenAI, StabilityAI).
- Content Moderation: If sharing designs or browsing othersâ€™ ideas, implement filters or moderation tools to prevent inappropriate content.
- Accessibility: Design UI with inclusive features (contrast, font sizes, keyboard navigation).

## Expected outcome
- A fully functional web app where users can input preferences and receive personalized tattoo design suggestions.
- Users can interact with generated designs, preview placements, and save or share them.
- The app encourages exploration of tattoo art and supports both individuals and artists in the design process.
- A user-friendly, aesthetic platform that sparks creativity and enhances the tattoo planning experience.
